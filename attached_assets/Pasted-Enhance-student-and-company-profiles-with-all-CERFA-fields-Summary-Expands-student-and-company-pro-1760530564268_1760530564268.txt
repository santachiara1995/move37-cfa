Enhance student and company profiles with all CERFA fields

Summary

Expands student and company profile forms from 8-9 basic fields to 30+ CERFA-compliant fields, organized in accordion sections for better UX. This enables complete CERFA PDF generation directly from student/company profiles without requiring manual data entry during contract creation.

Database Changes:

Students table: Added 20+ fields (usageName, nir, sex, address components, birth location, nationality, social regime, status flags, education history)
Entreprises table: Added 13+ fields (siret, address components, employer type/specific, NAF code, employee count, IDCC), made nom/prenom nullable (‚ö†Ô∏è potential breaking change)
Frontend Changes:

Student form: Reorganized into 6 accordion sections (Identit√©, Adresse, Contact, Statut, Formation, Identifiants)
Company form: Reorganized into 3 accordion sections (Identit√© de l'entreprise, Adresse, Contact)
All labels in French following existing conventions
Form handlers updated to collect all new fields
All new fields are nullable for backward compatibility with existing records.

Review & Testing Checklist for Human

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: This code was NOT tested locally due to environment issues (missing nanoid, no DATABASE_URL). All testing must be done after deployment.

Database (Priority: CRITICAL üî¥)

 Verify database migration runs successfully - 33+ new columns across 2 tables
 Verify all new columns exist in production database with correct types
 Check existing student/company records still load without errors
 Verify breaking change: entreprises.nom and entreprises.prenom are now nullable - check if any existing code assumes these are always present
Student Form (Priority: HIGH üü°)

 Create new student with all fields filled - verify all data saves correctly
 Create new student with only required fields (firstName, lastName, tenantId) - verify it works
 Edit existing student without new fields - verify form displays correctly and doesn't break
 Edit existing student and add new fields - verify updates work
 Test all 6 accordion sections expand/collapse correctly
 Verify checkbox fields work (highLevelAthlete, disabledWorker, businessProject)
Company Form (Priority: HIGH üü°)

 Create new company with all fields filled - verify all data saves correctly
 Create new company with only required fields (raisonSociale, nom, prenom, tenantId) - verify it works
 Verify 3 accordion sections expand/collapse correctly
 Check that form validation still works (required fields)
CERFA PDF Generation (Priority: HIGH üü°)

 Create contract with fully-populated student profile - verify all fields appear in generated CERFA PDF
 Create contract with fully-populated company profile - verify all fields appear in PDF
 Create contract with minimal student/company data - verify PDF generation doesn't break
Backward Compatibility (Priority: MEDIUM üü°)

 Load page with existing students that have no new fields - verify no errors
 Load page with existing companies that have no new fields - verify no errors
 Create contract using existing student/company records - verify it works
 Check if any code breaks from entreprises.nom/prenom being nullable (grep codebase for references)
